## Module 1 – GMDSS Fundamentals and Regulatory Framework

**Module Goal:** Build foundational understanding of the GMDSS concept, regulatory background, and basic communication principles.

### Lesson 1.1 – Introduction to GMDSS and SOLAS  (no quiz)

In this lesson, the trainee learns **why** GMDSS exists and how it connects to the SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) Convention.

Key points:

- Before GMDSS, distress calling relied heavily on manual watchkeeping and Morse code.  
- The SOLAS 1974 Convention and subsequent amendments mandated a more reliable, automated distress and safety system.  
- GMDSS ensures that a ship in distress can always reach a Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC), regardless of where the ship is sailing, by combining terrestrial and satellite systems.  
- The system is designed so that **distress alerts cannot be missed** if equipment and procedures are correctly followed.

By the end of Lesson 1.1, the trainee should be able to briefly explain what GMDSS is, which international convention drives it, and why it is mandatory for SOLAS-class vessels.

### Lesson 1.2 – GMDSS Sea Areas and Coverage  (with quiz)

This lesson explains how the world is divided into four GMDSS **Sea Areas** and how each area determines the equipment a ship must carry.

Content summary:

- **Sea Area A1** – Within VHF coverage of at least one coast station (typically 20–30 NM from shore) with continuous DSC watch on Ch 70.  
- **Sea Area A2** – Outside A1, but within MF coverage of at least one coast station (typically 100–150 NM), with continuous DSC watch on 2187.5 kHz.  
- **Sea Area A3** – Outside A1 and A2, within the coverage of an **Inmarsat geostationary satellite** (approximately between 70°N and 70°S).  
- **Sea Area A4** – Polar regions outside A1, A2, and A3, where HF systems (and sometimes non‑Inmarsat satellite services) are used.

Trainees should be able to:

- Identify which Sea Area a given voyage mainly operates in.  
- Link each Sea Area to the **minimum communication equipment** required.  
- Understand that many ships operate in overlapping areas and therefore carry a combination of VHF, MF/HF, and satellite equipment.

#### Quiz – Lesson 1.2: Sea Areas and Coverage

   A vessel trading exclusively within 20 NM of the coast, always within VHF range of a coast station with continuous DSC watch, is operating in:  
   - A. Sea Area A2  
   - B. Sea Area A1  
   - C. Sea Area A3  
   - D. Sea Area A4  
   **Correct answer:** B  

2. (Multiple choice – select all that apply)  
   Which of the following statements about Sea Area A3 are correct?  
   - A. It lies outside A1 and A2 but within Inmarsat geostationary satellite coverage  
   - B. It covers only areas within 20–30 NM of the coast  
   - C. It typically applies to ocean passages between 70°N and 70°S  
   - D. It is defined by MF coast station coverage only  
   **Correct answers:** A, C  

3. (True or False)  
   Sea Area A4 consists of high-latitude polar regions outside A1, A2, and A3 and relies primarily on HF and non‑geostationary satellite systems.  
   - A. True  
   - B. False  
   **Correct answer:** A

### Lesson 1.3 – GMDSS System Components and Ship Station Requirements  (with quiz)

This lesson breaks down the **main equipment groups** that make up a GMDSS ship station and how carriage requirements are determined.

Content summary:

- Core components often include:  
  - VHF radiotelephone with DSC (Ch 70)  
  - MF/HF radio with DSC (where applicable)  
  - Inmarsat ship earth station(s) for A3 operations  
  - EPIRB (406 MHz), properly registered and tested  
  - SART or AIS-SART units for locating survival craft  
  - NAVTEX receiver and/or SafetyNET systems for MSI  
- Carriage requirements depend on:
  - Ship type (e.g. cargo or passenger ship)  
  - Gross tonnage  
  - Sea Areas in which the ship operates.

The trainee should understand that the goal of carriage requirements is **functional equivalence**: the ship must have a reliable way to send distress alerts and receive MSI in all areas where it operates.

   - B. False  
   **Correct answer:** A

### Lesson 1.4 – Distress, Urgency, and Safety Communications Overview  (no quiz)

This lesson introduces the **priority hierarchy** used in maritime communications:

- **Distress (MAYDAY)** – Imminent danger to a ship, aircraft, or person; immediate assistance required.  
- **Urgency (PAN-PAN)** – Urgent message concerning safety of a ship or person but no immediate danger.  
- **Safety (SECURITÉ)** – Messages related to navigational or meteorological warnings, ice reports, etc.

The lesson also describes:

- Basic structure of a distress alert (MMSI, nature of distress, position, time).  
- Follow-up distress traffic on appropriate distress channels after a DSC alert.  
- Importance of keeping a log of all distress, urgency, and safety communications.

The aim is to prepare trainees for later, more detailed **procedure drills** in the practical modules.
