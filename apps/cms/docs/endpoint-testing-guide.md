When testing API endpoints, follow these:

0. Examine clearly the correct endpoint in apps/cms that is subject for testing.
1. Use the local URL http://localhost:3001/api
2. Use the PAYLOAD_API_KEY=13486c38-c99b-489a-bac0-8977d6c2d710 header for authentication
3. Use a direct command in the terminal to test endpoints, no need to create files.
