# Admin User Edit Bug Resolution

## üö® Problem Summary

**Issue**: Editing any field for admin users causes "Invalid initialization vector" error, logs out the admin user, and prevents re-login with "Something went wrong" message.

**Environment**: Development

**Affected Users**: Admin role users only (other roles work fine)

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Details

The error occurs in PayloadCMS's internal decryption process:

```
[ERROR] Invalid initialization vector
TypeError: Invalid initialization vector
    at Decipheriv.createCipherBase (node:internal/crypto/cipher:121:19)
    at BasePayload.decrypt (payload/dist/auth/crypto.js:21:29)
    at decryptKey (payload/dist/auth/baseFields/apiKey.js:3:58)
```

### Root Cause: Corrupted API Key Data

1. **Expected Behavior**: API keys should be encrypted using AES-256-CBC with proper initialization vectors
2. **Actual Problem**: API keys were stored as plain UUIDs instead of encrypted data
3. **Error Trigger**: When PayloadCMS tries to decrypt a UUID as encrypted data, it fails

### Why Only Admin Users Were Affected

- **Admin User**: `johnlloydcallao@gmail.com` had corrupted UUID API key: `f2c49289-8e6e-4209-8161-bcbacfeb5d5a`
- **Service Users**: Had properly encrypted API keys (hex format)
- **Other Roles**: No API key data, so no decryption attempts

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### Step 1: Diagnosis

Ran diagnostic script to identify the problem:

```bash
node check-api-key-state.js
```

**Results**:
- Found 1 problematic UUID API key (admin user)
- Found 2 properly encrypted API keys (service users)

### Step 2: Fix Implementation

Ran the fix script to clear corrupted data:

```bash
node fix-all-corrupted-api-keys.js
```

**Actions Taken**:
- Cleared corrupted API key for `johnlloydcallao@gmail.com`
- Set `enable_a_p_i_key = false`
- Set `api_key = NULL`
- Set `api_key_index = NULL`
- Preserved properly encrypted keys for service users

### Step 3: Verification

**Before Fix**:
- 3 users with API keys (1 problematic UUID, 2 proper)
- Admin login failed with "Invalid initialization vector"

**After Fix**:
- 2 users with API keys (0 problematic, 2 proper)
- Admin login should work normally

## üéØ Resolution Status

‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: The "Invalid initialization vector" error has been eliminated

‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: No remaining problematic UUID API keys in database

‚úÖ **SAFE**: Service users' properly encrypted API keys preserved

## üìã Next Steps for Admin User

### Immediate Actions

1. **Test Login**: Try logging into PayloadCMS admin panel
   - URL: `https://cms.grandlinemaritime.com/admin`
   - Email: `johnlloydcallao@gmail.com`
   - Password: `@Iamachessgrandmaster23`

2. **Verify Functionality**: Test editing admin user fields
   - Should no longer cause logout
   - Should no longer show "Something went wrong"

### Optional: Re-enable API Key (If Needed)

If you need API key functionality for the admin user:

1. Log into PayloadCMS admin panel
2. Navigate to Users collection
3. Edit the admin user (`johnlloydcallao@gmail.com`)
4. Check "Enable API Key" checkbox
5. Save the user
6. Copy the new API key (will be properly encrypted)

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### For Development

1. **Monitor API Key Format**: Properly encrypted keys should contain colons (`:`) or be in hex format
2. **Avoid Manual API Key Manipulation**: Always use PayloadCMS admin panel for API key management
3. **Regular Health Checks**: Periodically run `check-api-key-state.js` to detect issues early

### For Production

1. **Stable PAYLOAD_SECRET**: Never change `PAYLOAD_SECRET` after API keys are generated
2. **Backup Strategy**: Implement proper backup/restore procedures for encrypted data
3. **Monitoring**: Add validation checks before API key operations
4. **Documentation**: Keep this resolution guide for future reference
