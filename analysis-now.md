Now, answer only my question. Can we move that entire search icon including that modal that appears when we click it into shared packages?

As in the entire pure UI making it resuable, including the structure for Recent search section, and the UI structure of the search results, as you can see, it has some very thin row lines for each result list, we must copy that exact UI.

HOWEVER, WE DON'T INCLUDE THE data fetching process or data source process. Why? So that it will be adaptable to any type of data source for searching in the future. We are only interested in the UI behavior and structure purely but excluding the data fetching or data source. Is it possible? Please answer only my question.
